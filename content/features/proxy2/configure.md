This page is about configuring the Memcached built-in proxy.

For a general overview of the proxy, see [Proxy]({{<legacy_proxy_base_path>}}). For a hands-on tutorial that guides you through compiling and running the proxy with a simple configuration, see [Built-in Proxy Quickstart]({{<proxy_base_path>}}quickstart).

## Before you begin {#prereqs}

Before you and configure and run the proxy, you need the following:

* Memcached, with proxy features enabled, installed on your system.
* The proxy route library file downloaded to some path on your file system.

For more information, see [Install the built-in proxy]({{<proxy_base_path>}}install).

## Create a proxy configuration file {#create}

Before you can run the proxy, you need to create a configuration that lists the pools of Memcached servers that you want to use as the proxy's back end, and describes the routing trees that you want the proxy to use.

The configuration extends the standard proxy route library. It uses Lua syntax, but you don't need to know how to program in Lua to create and modify the configuration file.

While advanced users can modify the route library itself, the techniques described on this page focus on using the route library as-is, which covers the majority of Memcached proxy use-cases.

### Overview of the configuration file {#overview}

The configuration file has four general parts:

1. Optional invocations of global functions to turn on logging or debugging features.
1. An optional `settings{}` block, which sets various proxy settings to values other than their defaults.
1. One or more `pools{}` blocks, which define groups of backend Memcached servers that the proxy routes queries to.
1. One or more `routes{}` blocks, which lay out the rules by which the proxy routes requests to the pools defined in the `pools{}` blocks.

    It's common to have only one `routes{}` block. If you want to have the router handle requests differently depending upon connection context, [you can define multiple `routes{}` blocks](#multiple-trees).

The following sections detail the contents of each of the above parts, with examples.

### Enable logging and debugging {#logging}

To enable logging and debugging features of the routing library, include any of the following function calls at the top of the configuration file:

* `verbose(true)` has Memcached print additional information to standard output when loading the proxy configuration. This setting also lets you use the `say({{<var>}}TEXT{{</var>}})` function to print <var>TEXT</var> to standard output while loading your custom configuration.

* `debug(true)` turns on a debugging mode that is mainly useful if you are modifying the routing library. This setting also lets you use the `dsay({{<var>}}TEXT{{</var>}})` function to print <var>TEXT</var> to standard output while loading the proxy configuration.

### Adjust proxy settings {#settings}

To fine-tune various proxy behaviors, include a `settings{}` block in your configuration file. The block can set new values for any of the settings listed under [Proxy settings reference]({{<proxy_base_path>}}settings-reference).

For example, the following `settings{}` block sets a three-second backend connection timeout, and an upper limit of five active requests:

```lua
settings {
    backend_connect_timeout = 3,
    active_req_limit = 5,
}
```

### Define backend pools {#pools}

Use the required `pools{}` block to define the locations and other attributes of the back-end Memcached servers that the router directs queries to.

You can optionally define more than one `pools{}` block. Doing so is functionally equivalent to combining all of their contents into a single `pools{}` block. For the sake of simplicity, this documentation uses example configuration files with only one `pools{}` block.

The `pools{}` block contains one or more pool definitions in the following format:

```lua
{{<var>}}POOL_NAME{{</var>}} = {
    options = { {{<var>}}OPTIONS{{</var>}} },
    backend_options = { {{<var>}}BACKEND_OPTIONS{{</var>}} },
    backends = {
        "{{<var>}}HOST{{</var>}}:{{<var>}}PORT{{</var>}}",
        {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}}
    }
}
```

Replace the following:

* <var>POOL_NAME</var>: a name for this pool—for example, `northeast_1`.
* <var>POOL_OPTIONS</var>: (optional) a comma-separated list, in `key=value` format, of settings for the proxy to apply to this pool. For a list of settings, see [Pool API]({{<legacy_proxy_base_path>}}#pool-api).
* <var>BACKEND_OPTIONS</var>: (optional) a comma-separated list, in `key=value` format, of settings for the proxy to apply to all of the backends in the pool. For a list of settings, see [Backend API]({{<legacy_proxy_base_path>}}#backend-api).
* <var>HOST</var>: the IP address or hostname of the Memcached server you are defining as a backend.
* <var>PORT</var>: (optional) the TCP port of the Memcached server you are defining as a backend. The default value is `11211`.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}Don't start any pool name with `set_`. That name style is reserved for sets of pools. For more information, see [Define sets of pools](#sets).{{</callout>}}

To fine-tune the proxy settings for an individual backend, replace its entry in the `backends` list with a curly-braced list of back-end options. The list must include `host`.

The following example defines two backends, including one that runs on port 11212 and has a ten-second connection timeout:

```lua
backends = {
    "127.0.0.1:11211",   
    { host = "127.0.0.1", port = 11212, connecttimeout = 10 },
}
```

Putting things into more context, the following example `pools{}` block defines two pools with three backends each:

```lua
pools {
    main_pool = {
        backend_options = { connecttimeout = 5 },
        backends = {
            "192.0.2.1",
            "192.0.2.2",
            "192.0.2.3:11212",
        }
    },
    customer_pool = {
        backends = {
            "203.0.113.1",
            "203.0.113.10",
            { host = "203.0.113.20", port = 11212, connecttimeout = 10 },
        },
    },
}
```

#### Define sets of pools {#sets}

You can optionally gather pools into named _sets_, each of which contains a list of pool definitions. You might want to employ this technique if you have several pools of backends that you want the router to treat as mutually equivalent with synchronized data:

```lua
{{<var>}}SET_NAME{{</var>}} = {
    {
        { backends = {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}} },
        { backends = {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}} },
        {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}}
    },
    {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}}
}
```

Replace <var>SET_NAME</var> with a name for this set of pools—for example, `set_customer_pools`. The name must begin with `set_`.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}If you don't start a set's name with `set_`, then Memcached reads it as an ordinary pool definition, likely resulting in a syntax error.{{</callout>}}

Sets are also useful when organizing pools into named zones as part of an ordered failover strategy. For more information, see [Prioritize a route using local zones](#zones).

### Define proxy routes

Use the required `routes{}` block to define how the proxy should handle data storage or retrieval queries. Generally speaking, this involves forwarding requests involving specific keys or commands to the various pools of Memcached servers that you defined in the `pools{}` section. You can use the many route handlers that the routing library provides to forward these requests in a variety of ways.

{{< callout type="info" >}}The `route{}` block has a wide range of options available, making this documentation section rather complex. For some helpful examples of the `route{}` block in action, see [Example configuration files](#examples).{{</callout>}}

A `routes{}` block contains least one of the following:

* A `map` section that maps key prefixes to route handlers. You can pair this with an optional `conf` section for tuning how the proxy separates prefix strings out from key names.
* A `cmap` section that maps Memcached commands to route handlers.
* A `default` section that specifies a route handler for any requests which don't match any of the conditions in the `map` or `cmap` sections.

For more information about route handlers, see [Key concepts]({{<proxy_base_path>}}#concepts).

The following sections explain these configuration sections in more detail.

#### The `map` section {#map}

The `map` section of `routes{}` defines a list of key prefixes, mapping each one to a specific route handler. The mapping includes the names of the pools or sets that the route handler takes as arguments:


```lua
map = {
    {{<var>}}KEY_PREFIX{{</var>}} = {{<var>}}HANDLER_TYPE{{</var>}}{ {{<var>}}HANDLER_ARGS{{</var>}} },
    {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}} 
},
```

Replace the following:

* <var>KEY_PREFIX</var>: the key prefix to map to this route handler.
    
* <var>HANDLER_TYPE</var>: the name of a route library handler. For a list of all of the handlers available, see [Route handler reference]({{<proxy_base_path>}}reference).

* <var>HANDLER_ARGS</var>: the arguments to pass to the route handler. Typically, this is where you name one or more pools. The list of arguments and their expected syntax depends on the handler type. For more information, see [Route handler reference]({{<proxy_base_path>}}reference).

The following example `route{}` block configures the proxy to direct all requests for keys with the `cust` prefix, such as `cust/key-12345` and `cust/another-key-321`, to a pool named `customer_pool`. It has no `conf` section because it relies on the default prefix style.

```lua
route {
    map = {
        cust = route_direct {
            child = "customer_pool",
        },
    },
    
    default = { {{<var>}}[...]{{</var>}} },
}
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}Pool names and key prefixes don't need to be similar in the way that `customer_pool` and `cust/key-12345` are. However, it can be good practice to give pools and their corresponding key prefixes similar names, for the sake of clarity.{{</callout>}}

You can further refine `map` directives to handle requests only when they match specific prefixes and Memcached commands, together. For more information, see [Restrict route handlers to certain commands]({{<proxy_base_path>}}reference#commands). 

#### The `conf` section {#conf}

If you define a `map` section, then you can also define an optional `conf` section, which tells the proxy how to parse key prefixes.

By default the proxy reads everything in the key's name before its first `/` as its prefix. If the key has no `/` character, then the proxy handles the request with no prefix. For example, the default prefix of `cust/12345` is `cust`. You can use a `conf` section of a `route{}` block to change this behavior:

```lua
conf = {
    mode = "{{<var>}}MODE{{</var>}}",
    start = "{{<var>}}START_STRING{{</var>}}",
    stop = "{{<var>}}STOP_STRING{{</var>}}",
},
```

Replace the following:

* <var>MODE</var>: (optional) the technique that the proxy applies to determine the prefix of each key. The value must be one of the following:

    * `prefix`: The prefix is every character from the start of the key until the characters defined by the separate `stop` argument. This is the default.
    
    * `anchor`: The prefix is every character between the two substrings defined by the separate `start` and `stop` arguments.
    
* <var>START_STRING</var>: if the mode is `anchor`, then this is a substring of five or fewer characters at the start of every key name that precedes the prefix.

* <var>STOP_STRING</var>: a substring that separates the prefix from the remainder of the key name. The default is `/`.

#### The `cmap` section {#cmap}

To have the proxy handle requests differently depending upon the Memcached command that it receives, include a `cmap` section in your `routes{}` block. For example, you can configure the proxy to direct all `get` requests to one pool, regardless of prefix, and all `set` requests to a different pool.

```lua
cmap = {
    {{<var>}}KEY_PREFIX{{</var>}} = {{<var>}}HANDLER_TYPE{{</var>}}{ {{<var>}}HANDLER_ARGS{{</var>}} },
    {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}} 
},
```

The following example `cmap` section configures the proxy to forward all `get` requests to the pools named `main-1` and `main-2`, returning data from whichever one responds first:

```lua
route {
    cmap = {
        get = route_allfastest{
            children = { "main-1", "main-2" },
        },
    },

    default = { {{<var>}}[...]{{</var>}} },
}
```

Entries in the `cmap` configuration section match commands regardless of any associated key prefix. If you want to define router handlers that activate only when the proxy receives requests for specific key prefixes _and_ commands, then you can do that with `map` entries. For more information, see [Restrict route handlers to certain commands]({{<proxy_base_path>}}reference#commands).

#### The `default` section {#default}

To handle any requests that don't match any of the prefixes or commands defined in the `map` or `cmap` sections, add a `default` section. This section specifies a single route handler:

```lua
default = {{<var>}}HANDLER_TYPE{{</var>}}{ {{<var>}}HANDLER_ARGS{{</var>}} },
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}If you don't define a `default` section within a `route{}` block, then the proxy returns an error for any requests that don't match any `map` or `cmap` sections defined in that `route{}` block.{{</callout>}}

### Example configuration files {#examples}

The following example file demonstrates all four of the configuration file sections described earlier on this page:

```lua
-- Turn on the proxy's verbose mode.
verbose(true)

-- Override a handful of default settings for proxy behavior.
settings {
    backend_connect_timeout = 3,
    pool_options = {
        filter = "tags",
        filter_conf = "{}"
    }
}

-- Define two backend pools of Memcached servers. Each pool has three nodes.
pools {
    main_pool = {
        backend_options = { connecttimeout = 5 },
        backends = {
            "192.0.2.1",
            "192.0.2.2",
            "192.0.2.3:11212",
        }
    },
    customer_pool = {
        backends = {
            "203.0.113.1",
            "203.0.113.10",
            { host = "203.0.113.20", port = 11212, connecttimeout = 10 },
        },
    },
}

-- Define two routes, each of which maps to one of the pools defined earliers.
-- And then define a default catch-all route.
routes {
    map = {
        -- Handle keys that start with "main/"
        main = route_direct {
            child = "main_pool",
        },
        cust = cmdmap{
            -- Handle only SET commands for keys with the prefix with "cust"
            set = route_direct {
                child = "customer_pool",
            },
        },
    },

    -- Handle keys that don't have a mapped prefix.
    default = route_direct {
        child = "main_pool"
    },
}
```

This example also demonstrates how you can add comments, using [Lua comment syntax](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/lua/comments), to your proxy configuration file.

For several more examples demonstrating you can configure the proxy to handle various circumstances and topologies, see [the `examples` directory in the route library source](https://github.com/memcached/memcached-proxylibs/tree/main/lib/routelib/examples).

## Mark a backend as down {#down}

You can modify your proxy configuration file to mark a backend server as
being down. This action tells the proxy that the backend still exists, but is temporarily unavailable. Marking a backend as down has two effects:

* The proxy doesn't route any queries to the backend marked as down.
* The proxy doesn't remap any keys already stored on the backend.

To mark a backend as down, add the `_down_` keyword to its definition in the configuration file's `pools{}` block. The following example pool definition has one server marked as down:

```lua
    main_pool = {
        backends = {
            "192.0.2.1",
            "192.0.2.2 _down_",
            "192.0.2.3:11212",
        }
    },
```

If you have defined the backend using the alternate list-based syntax, then add `down=true` instead:

```lua
    customer_pool = {
        backends = {
            "203.0.113.1",
            "203.0.113.10",
            { host="203.0.113.20", port=11212, down=true, flaptime=10 },
        },
    },
```

To mark the backend as online again, remove the `_down_` or `down=true` attribute from the backend's definition in the proxy configuration file.

## Prioritize a route using local zones {#zones}

If you have [organized your pools into named sets](#sets), then you can further configure the proxy to prefer routing requests to certain pools within a set, even if other pools are available. You might want to do this to prefer routing requests to a pool that is geographically closer to the proxy, for example.

Doing this involves the following steps:

1. Declare a _local zone_ in your proxy configuration file.
1. Attach zone labels to the pools within your set definitions.
1. In your route definitions, invoke a route handler that makes use of zone information. The only such handler defined by the standard route library is `route_zfailover`.

To declare the local zone and attach zone labels to your defined pools, modify your configuration file's `pools{}` block like this:

```lua
local_zone("{{<var>}}LOCAL_ZONE_NAME{{</var>}}")

pools {
    {{<var>}}SET_NAME{{</var>}} = {
    {
        {{<var>}}POOL_ZONE_NAME{{</var>}} = { backends = {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}} },
        {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}}
    },
    {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}}
}
```

Replace the following:
* <var>LOCAL_ZONE_NAME</var>: the name of the zone that this proxy prefers to route requests to.
* <var>SET_NAME</var>: the name of this set of pools—for example, `set_customer_pools`. The name must begin with `set_`.
* <var>POOL_ZONE_NAME</var>: the name of the zone that this pool is in.

The following example excerpt from a proxy configuration file that declares a local zone—in this case, "`west`"—and then defines two sets of zoned pools.

```lua
local_zone("west")

pools {
    set_main_pools = {
        west   = {
            backends = {
                "192.0.2.1",
                "192.0.2.2",
                "192.0.2.3:11212",
            },
        south  = {
            backends = {
                {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}}
            },
        east   = {
            backends = { 
                {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}}
            } 
        },
    },
    
    set_customer_pools = {
        west   = {
            backends = {
                "203.0.113.1",
                "203.0.113.10",
                { host="203.0.113.20", port=11212, flaptime=10 },
            },
        south  = {
            backends = {
                {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}}
            },
        east   = {
            backends = { 
                {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}}
            } 
        },
    },
}
```

The only route handler that makes use of zone information is [`route_zfailover`]({{<proxy_base_path>}}reference#route_zfailover). The following proxy configuration excerpt extends the previous example with a `routes{}` block that uses `route_zfailover`.

```lua
routes {
    map = {
        main = route_zfailover {
            children = "set_main_pools",
        },
        cust = cmdmap{
            set = route_zfailover {
                children = "set_customer_pools",
            },
        },
    },

    default = route_allfastest {
        children = { "set_main_pools" }
    },
}
```

## Define multiple route trees {#multiple-trees}

You can configure the proxy to have more than one tree of route handlers, each with their own, separate `routes{}` block in the configuration file. The proxy chooses which `routes{}` block to apply to a given request depending on the TCP port that the request arrived on.

To define multiple route trees, follow these steps:

1. Define one `routes{}` block for each route tree. Within each block, define a `tag` that is unique to that block. You can optionally leave one `routes{}` block with no tag, which marks it as the default tree. The following example defines two tagged route trees named `main` and `alt`, and one default route tree:

    ```lua
    routes {
        tag = "main",
        map { {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}} },
    }
    
    routes {
        tag = "alt",
        map { {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}} },
    }
    
    routes {
        map { {{<var>}}[ ... ]{{</var>}} },
    }
    ```

1. Run the proxy so that it listens on one TCP port for every tree that you define. Assign the ports tags that match the tags you specified in your configuration file. Extending the previous example, that would mean running the proxy on at least two ports, tagging one `main` and the other `alt`.

    For more information, see [Run the proxy with multiple tagged TCP ports]({{<proxy_base_path>}}run#tags).

## Reconfigure a running proxy {#reload}

You can update your proxy configuration file without interrupting the proxy service. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Update your configuration file as needed.

1. Send a `SIGHUP` signal to the Memcached proxy:

    ```command
    kill -HUP {{<var>}}PROXY_PROCESS{{</var>}}
    ```

    Replace <var>PROXY_PROCESS</var> with the process ID of the proxy.
    
If the updated configuration file is valid, then Memcached reloads its configuration and continues running. Otherwise, Memcached exits with an error.
